<h3>SKE48 Matsui Jurina, plans for manzai, collaboration with graduated members, and producing! The opening of her YouTube channel, and her hopes and possibilities for it</h3>
<p>On 1 November, Matsui Jurina from the Nagoya-based group SKE48 held a livestream on her official YouTube channel.</p>
<p>The opening of this YouTube channel was announced during SKE48's 12th anniversary concert that took place from 3 October to 5 October, during a surprise announcement on the last day of performances. Furthermore, it was revealed that she had been recording during the concert, and with high engagement even from overseas fans, it garnered much attention even before the opening of the channel.</p>
<p>On the first livestream which took place at 8pm, Matsui delivered her broadcast with a smile and a hint of nervousness. There were many comments left by overseas fans, and there was also a greeting in English. In the stream, there was a segment where the channel name was chosen out of 80 suggestions from fans. Holding a pointing stick, Matsui introduced the suggestions that interested her while adding her own commentary. This was narrowed down to three choices, namely "Jurich", "JUTube", and "Jurina HOUSE", and out of the three "Jurina HOUSE" was selected as the channel name.</p>
<p>Matsui also revealed in the livestream her plans and ideas for the channel. While dealing with a prank the staff played on her, she made an announcement for an "MC Mascot General Election". The mascot character chosen will appear in the channel together with Matsui.</p>
<p>Finally, Matsui closed off by commenting, "I hope viewers will think of it as their own home, where they can feel recharged, have fun, and be entertained by many sides of Matsui Jurina. Please continue supporting me."</p>
<p>After the live stream, there was an interview with the press at the event, revealed below.</p>
<h4>Matsui Jurina post-livestream interview</h4>
<p><strong>Q: Please tell us your honest thoughts now that the livestream has ended.</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: While I kept going with the stream, the comments feed moved too quickly and it was difficult for me to follow. I'm planning to do more livestreams soon, so I think there are improvements that can be made. While deciding on the name for the channel, there were so many great suggestions that I thought it would take some time to decide on one, but unexpectedly there was one that resonated with me that it took no time at all. I was worried that there was too much time left for the stream after that.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The channel name was decided to be "Jurina HOUSE", what made you decide on that name?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: When you look at the name "Jurina HOUSE", it gives you the feeling of a place you come back to after work or school, where you can relax. After spending a lot of your own time in various other places, I hope this channel will be the place you return to.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What made you want to start doing YouTube?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: Because we're in these times, part of me wanted to go spread fun things. During the self-restraint period, I was actively doing Instagram lives, and also because my graduation was postponed, I felt like I had to do something. Recently there was also an increase in overseas fans, and I think YouTube is a great tool to reach people from overseas. Also, a senior I get along with, Shinoda Mariko-san also started her YouTube channel, and she told me many things about YouTube which made me want to give it a go.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What kinds of things do you want to do on YouTube?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: I'd like to try getting taught about manzai and comedy and then actually trying it. Right now the thing I want to do the most is to do the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtpL14W5Of8">exercise routine with Jungle Pocket-san</a>. Personally I also like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx3omarJbBA">Pekopa-san</a>, so I'd love to meet them! (Shuupei pose)</p>
<p><strong>Q: You also mentioned in the stream about collaborating with graduated members?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: Yes, that's right. Many graduated members have started their own YouTube channels, and there were some who did mention wanting to collaborate, and it would be great if we could make this happen. It would've been a while since we appeared together, so just a dialogue would be great, but if we're going to do it, we might as well also do some projects together.</p>
<p><strong>Q: You also expressed an interest in doing some producing</strong></p>
<p>I'm really interested! Previously, the members and I discussed projects for a TV show, and I am really looking forward to it. Up until now, I have already done a lot of producing work for myself as well as the group, but I want to try doing it for someone else and making them shine.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Your graduation has been postponed, but the new single release has been decided. What are your feelings about it at this time?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: It was unfortunate that my graduation was postponed, but there were things I was only able to do because that happened. These two days, I was at an event where I was able to meet the fans. Had it gone according to plan, I would have graduated without meeting many of my fans. Knowing that, there were many fans who told me things like "it's great I got to see you", so I'd love to create more chances like that. Also had my graduation not be postponed, I may not have wanted to start my YouTube channel.</p>
<p><strong>Q: About the "Local Talk Event" held during these two days where you were able to talk with fans, how was it?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: A while back it was limited to Aichi residents only, but this time people from all over the country came. Many of them told me "it's been a year since I last saw you!". The things that were said to me the most were "I'm happy I got to see you before you graduate", and "part of me is sad that this might be our last time to see each other", and it really sunk in that I was really going to be graduating.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Did you feel lonely about it?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: Yes I did! Half of my life was spent in SKE, and it had become a part of my life I took for granted. I'm a product of SKE48.</p>
<p><strong>Q: There are also many who are saying "I don't want you to graduate!"</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: I'm happy to hear such comments. Personally, the moment I felt like I'm able to leave the group to the other girls, and also when I was happy about the growth of the members, that's when I thought I'm able to graduate. I think that's the right timing. Right now SKE48 is unified, and even when I had to go on hiatus, I could see that SKE48 was able to move forward without me. That's what prompted me to think it's alright to graduate, and I'm looking forward to seeing SKE48's future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you continue doing YouTube after graduating?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: I'll keep doing it until I give up on it!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Honestly, how many subscribers are you aiming for?</strong></p>
<p>Matsui: It's fine even if it needs to take many years to reach this level, but I'm hoping to get 1 million subscribers! I want to get the gold plate! (laughs)</p>
